        <div id = "question">Why did I receive account details instead of a cdkey?</div>
        <div id = "answer">
            You received account details instead of a key because that's what you purchased initially,</br>
            please re-read the product title and description for more details on what you purchased. If you do not want the account, please <a class = "faqcontact" href = "mailto:mateuszek.boom@gmail.com">contact us</a> so that we can resolve the issue quickly.</div></br>
        
        <div id = "question">How does that work?</div>
        <div id = "answer">    
        Simply you type your e-mail, kinguin order id and redeem code that you received. And on e-mail you provided us we sent you new account and e-mail data.
        </div></br>

        <div id = "question">How do I know you won't take back the account?</div>
        <div id = "answer">Kinguin does not respect allegations of fraud among its merchants and is therefore very sensitive about it.</br>
            The data to the received account and to the e-mail can be changed immediately after receiving them, but if you are still afraid, kinguin has a money back guarantee so you can be sure you're safe. </div></br>

        <div id = "question">Can I return the account after I used it?</div>
        <div id = "answer">You cannot return the account after you logged into it as this poses a security risk for us.</div></br>

        <div id = "question">Can I change the account details and login?</div>
        <div id = "answer">You can change all the details associated with the account after receiving it. The account belongs completely and only to you after purchase.</div></br>

        <div id = "question">How long is the delivery time?</div>
        <div id = "answer">    
        Up to 24h, but in most cases (if you ordered between 9am-22pm) we deliver the product within 2 hours max.
